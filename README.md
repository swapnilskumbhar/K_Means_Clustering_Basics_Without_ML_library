# K_Means_Clustering_Basics_Without_ML_library
In this repository, I have tried to explain the K means clustering basics. 
Based on screen size and the ram that one device have we will try to determine if the device is a mobile or laptop using K_means clustering algorithm, 
I hope you will understand the basic math used behind the algorithm.
